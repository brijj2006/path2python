"""The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state.
The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the
data members of the class when an object of class is created.
Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions)
that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class
is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object."""
